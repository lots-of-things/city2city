# city2city
asking the pressing question, "are all cities just isomorphic transformations of one another?"  This is a project attempting to map cities onto one another using neighborhood data (currently yelp businesses).

[This notebook](build_maps_and_similarity.ipynb) has the map svg rendering and the neighborhood similarity calculation.  Currently, I'm looking for a better way to do the similarity calculation, and I'm hoping to get a different dataset for the comparison.
